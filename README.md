Hi this is my example demo rest-api using NestJS and Mongoose
  -This example is about Cat API and I will add some relations after (In process)
  -Technologies used: NestJS, Mongoose (MongoDB Data Object Model), Swagger UI (API Document)
  -How to start NestJS project
    + At the root project folder: run command : npm run start or npm run start:dev(Restart project every file changes)
    + At the browser: See all available API -> Swagger UI: localhost://3000/api
